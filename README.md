> The palest ink is better than the best memory。

I used to note some important notes in the specialized software. But these notes always are separate in different directories because I just write when I have a idea. It's not helpful for managing to me. So I decide to write [blog](https://kotilic.github.io) to pick up those separate notes and generate new ideas that I can share with you. Wish Improve with you.

I have much interests. There will be some topics in my blog, including but not limited. Front End, Back End, Computer science, AI(Deeping Learing, Machine Learning)? Electronics, Radio, Kali Linux. Some notes will be the translation from some popular MOOC courses, such as **Coursera**,**Udacity**,**Edx**,**网易云课堂** , or some paid courses(of course, I paid). So, If you like or find something wrong in the notes, please tell me both. Appreciate it and Thanks.
